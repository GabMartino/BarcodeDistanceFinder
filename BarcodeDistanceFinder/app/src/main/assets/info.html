    Information on Barcode Distance Finder
</h1>
<h2>
    How does it work?
</h2>
<b>
    This application use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/vision">Mobile Vision library</a>
    to detect barcodes from the image.<br>
    The barcodes detected have specific contour around them with some sizes. These information are used with a bit of arithmetic to capture distance information.

<br/>
<b>f(mm):</b> Focal lenght of the camera.<br>
<b>Height<sub>o</sub>(mm):</b> Real height of the object that we want to calculate the distance with.<br>
<b>Height<sub>i</sub>(pixels):</b> Size of the image visualized. (This depends on the preview size selected from the device camera. <br>
<b>c</b> Ratio between the resolution of the device and the resolution of the camera source.<br>
<b>Height<sub>o</sub>(pixels):</b> Object height in pixels, this are the values of the preview size.<br>
<b>Height<sub>s</sub>(pixels):</b> Size of the sensor of the camera, specific for each device.<br>

<h2>
    What does that information mean?
</h2>

<b>Quality</b> If the device is correctly calibrated from the manufacturer to detect the distances '1' is shown, otherwise a lower value. In the latter case the distance calculated is unreliable.<br>
<b>MinFocusDistance</b> This value represent the diopters of the minimum focus.(Diopter = 1/meters)<br>
<b>HyperFocalDistance</b> This value represents the diopters of the maximum focus.<br>
